/**
 * This factory is useful when used by another MimeMessageFactory which delegates the creation of MimeMessages
 * to another MimeMessageFactory, such as with a UserAndGroup Iterator MimeMessageFactory. For example:
 *
 * <code>
 * {{velocity}}
 * ## Create a mime message, the way you like it, adding any part you like, without recipient.
 * #set ($message = $services.mail.sender.createMessage('localhost@xwiki.org', null, 'SendMimeMessageToGroup'))
 * #set ($discard = $message.addPart('text/plain', 'text content'))
 *
 * ## Use the mime message cloning factory as message factory to duplicate the created message
 * #set ($parameters = {'hint' : 'message', 'source' : $message})
 *
 * #set ($source = {'groups' : [$services.model.createDocumentReference('', 'XWiki', 'XWikiAllGroup')]})
 *
 * #set ($messages = $services.mail.sender.createMessages('usersandgroups', $source, $parameters))
 * #set ($result = $services.mail.sender.send($messages, 'database'))
 * {{/velocity}}
 * </code>
 *
 * Since 7.4.1, messages generated all receive the same MessageId header since these are clone of the same message.
 * This behavior allow sending newsletter/mailing list message independently to many subscribers
 * while allowing them to interact on the same thread of message, since all message are identified to be the same.
 *
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 7.1M2

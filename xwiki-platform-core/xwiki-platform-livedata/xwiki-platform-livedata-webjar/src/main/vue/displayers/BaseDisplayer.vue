<!--
  BaseDisplayer is a component that provide for specific displayers
  an interface that already handles the displayer's base behavior:
  focus, switch to edit or view mode, etc.
  It is not meant to be used directly, but instead to be used inside a
  specific displayer that pass to it a `viewer` and `editor` slot.
  In that way, specific displayers only care about implementing
  the formatting of its content (view mode and edit mode)
  instead of reimplemting the whole displayer logic each time.
-->

    :class="isView ? 'view' : 'edit'"

    <!--
      The base displayer contains two slots: `viewer` and `editor`.
      It displays the one according to its current state: `this.isView`.

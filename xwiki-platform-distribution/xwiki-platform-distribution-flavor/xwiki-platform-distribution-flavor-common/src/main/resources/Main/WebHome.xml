  <content>= Welcome to your wiki =

XWiki is the best tool to organize your knowledge. A //wiki// is organized in a hierarchy of //pages//. You can create multiple wikis, each with its own set of pages.

XWiki can be used as a knowledge base (support, documentation, sales, etc.), for collaborative workspaces or even as a complete intranet.

= The basics =

To make the most out of your wiki, log-in and:

Use the {{displayIcon name="pencil"/}} button above to //edit// this page and start customizing your wiki to your needs.

Use the {{displayIcon name="add"/}} button above to //add// more pages to your wiki and create the //hierarchy// that best organizes your content.

Use the {{displayIcon name="home"/}} breadcrumbs located above the title to //navigate// inside your pages. It's easy to get lost in a big wiki without them.

You can also use the [[Sandbox&gt;&gt;Sandbox.WebHome]] for more demo content and generally a place to experiment with your wiki's features. 

 {{box}}Learn more on how to use XWiki with the {{velocity}}[[Getting Started Guide&gt;&gt;http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/WebHome?version=$xwiki.version]]{{/velocity}}.{{/box}}

= Extend your wiki =

To extend the power and functionalities of your wiki with the features that //you// need, head over to the {{velocity}}[[Extension Manager&gt;&gt;path:$xwiki.getURL($services.model.createDocumentReference('wiki', 'XWiki', 'XWikiPreferences'), 'admin', 'editor=globaladmin&amp;section=XWiki.Extensions')]]{{/velocity}} where you can search for and install extensions.

To browse through the 900+ community contributed extensions available for XWiki, head over to the [[Extensions Repository&gt;&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org]].

= Create your application =

Go beyond the available extensions and define the //structure// of your data based on //your// needs, creating //your// own applications with [[App Within Minutes&gt;&gt;AppWithinMinutes]] (AWM). 

AWM will take care of making it easy for you and your users to create and manage the data.

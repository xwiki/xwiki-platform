     * to other users, thus reducing the amount of spam.  If you are using
     * an IRC network where this kind of policy is enforced, you will need
     * to make your bot <i>identify</i> itself to NickServ before you can send
     * private messages. Assuming you have already registered your bot's
     * nick with NickServ, this method can be used to <i>identify</i> with
     * the supplied password. It usually makes sense to identify with NickServ
     * immediately after connecting to a server.
     * <p>
     * This method issues a raw NICKSERV command to the server, and is therefore
     * safer than the alternative approach of sending a private message to
     * NickServ. The latter approach is considered dangerous, as it may cause
     * you to inadvertently transmit your password to an untrusted party if you
     * connect to a network which does not run a NickServ service and where the
     * untrusted party has assumed the nick "NickServ".  However, if your IRC
     * network is only compatible with the private message approach, you may
     * typically identify like so:
     * <pre>sendMessage("NickServ", "identify PASSWORD");</pre>
     * <p>
     * Note that this method will add a temporary listener for ConnectEvent if
     * the bot is not logged in yet. If the bot is logged in the command is sent
     * immediately to the server

     * @param password The password which will be used to identify with NickServ.

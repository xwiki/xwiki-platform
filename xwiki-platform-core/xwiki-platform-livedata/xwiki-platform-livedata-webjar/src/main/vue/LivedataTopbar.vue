<!--
  The LivedataTopbar component can be use to create consistent topbars
  for the different layout implementations.
  It usually contains the dropdown menu, the refresh button, the global search
  and the pagination.

  It contains two slots: `left` and `right`, that allows to quickly
  organize its content to stick to the left or to the right

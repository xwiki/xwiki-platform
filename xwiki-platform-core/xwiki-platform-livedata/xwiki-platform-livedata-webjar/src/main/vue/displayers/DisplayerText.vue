<!--
  DisplayerText is a custom displayer that displays the entry value as text.
  This is the simpliest displayer, as it does not even implement new widget
  instead of the BaseDisplayer default ones!
-->
<template>
  <!--
    Uses the BaseDisplayer as root element, as it handles for us
    all the displayer default behavior
  -->
  <BaseDisplayer

    :entry="entry"

    <!-- Keep the default Viewer widget -->

    <!-- Keep the default Editor widget -->

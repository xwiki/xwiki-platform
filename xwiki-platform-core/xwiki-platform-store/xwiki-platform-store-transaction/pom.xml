  <description>
    The common and error prone way of saving things in the database is to open a transaction, enter a
    try clause, do something then commit. If we catch an exception, then we rollback.
    something like this:

    begin transaction;
    try {
    do something;
    do something else;
    commit;
    } catch (Any exception which may occur) {
    rollback;
    }

    There are 3 things which can go wrong. 1 we forget to begin the transaction, 2 we forget to commit
    and 3 we do not rollback properly. What makes things worse is often the database will "assume we
    meant to..." and things will work okay most of the time which makes things much worse because bugs
    will hide very well.

    This module answers the problem with a class called TransactionRunnable. It provides a set of 5 empty
    methods to override: onPreRun(), onRun(), onCommit(), onRollback(), and onComplete(). the exact
    circumstances under which each are called is documented in the javadoc comments.

    To repeat our original example with TransactionRunnable you might say this:

    public class DoSomethingTransactionRunnable extends TransactionRunnable
    {
    public void onRun()
    {
    do something;
    do something else;
    }
    }

    Now we can use another TransactionRunnable which opens and closes the transaction for us.

    StartableTransactionRunnable transaction = new SQLTransactionRunnable();
    new DoSomethingTransactionRunnable().runIn(transaction);
    transaction.start();

    the runIn() function allows us to run one TransactionRunnable inside of another. Supposing we wanted
    to reuse "do something else" in other places, we can make it a separate TransactionRunnable and use
    the runIn() function to hook it to our DoSomethingTransactionRunnable IE:

    public class DoSomethingTransactionRunnable extends TransactionRunnable
    {
    public DoSomethingTransactionRunnable()
    {
    new DoSomethingElseTransactionRunnable().runIn(this);
    }
    ..
    }

    The only limitations on running TransactionRunnables inside of one another are they cannot run more
    than once and they cannot call themselves (this would be an infinite loop).

    This pattern makes each job which is done on storage easily isolated and, as I have so far
    experienced, trivial to test. However, it still leaves the possibility that we might forget that
    DoSomethingTransactionRunnable must be run inside of a database transaction. This module provides a
    solution for this too. Using generics, it offers a means for the author of a TransactionRunnable to
    communicate to the compiler what other TransactionRunnable their runnable must be run in and without
    explicit casting or defining of an intermediary runnable, this requirement cannot be violated or
    else it wouldn't compile!

    Finally we have the issue of starting the runnable. Who's to say I won't be tired one day and just
    write "new DoSomethingTransactionRunnable().start()" without opening a transaction first? If
    DoSomethingTransactionRunnable cannot be safely run outside of a transaction all it needs to do is
    not extend StartableTransactionRunnable and it won't have any start function.

    This module takes a multitude of very easy mistakes and gives the author of a TransactionRunnable the
    tools to make it very hard for the user to make them. Also, since a TransactionRunnable has no
    reason to be very long (it can just branch off into another runnable) this will make testing and
    code review easy in the place where it is most important. This part of the code is entirely generic
    and has no dependence on any type of underlying transactional storage engine.

    <!-- JBoss AS automatically adds some dependencies. For example for JBoss AS7, see:
         https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Implicit+module+dependencies+for+deployments

         Some of these dependencies are also provided by XWiki and are thus conflicting.
         As a consequence we need to stop JBoss AS to add some of the dependencies that conflict.

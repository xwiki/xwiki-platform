This is simple Java Persistance Query Language (JPQL, part of EJB3 standard)
parser with XWQL additions, based on SableCC[1].

Support almost full features of select statement.
Missed: enums, separation of fields types (collection, single valued, etc.
 All fields considered as paths).

Parser is useful for preprocess JPQL queries for some manipulations.
Without dependencies.
Any other JPQL parser for the moment is specialized, hard to use 
outside its product or cannot used for preprocessing.

SableCC provides good auto generated parse model (node package) 
with visitor pattern support (analysis package) and toString.

JPQL grammar based on JPA2[2] specification EBNF plus part of 
eclipselink antlr grammar[3] for resolve ambiguity (expression rules) 

Don't forget to add target/generated-sources/sablecc to build path, 
if you use IDE for this project (or want to build project without maven2).

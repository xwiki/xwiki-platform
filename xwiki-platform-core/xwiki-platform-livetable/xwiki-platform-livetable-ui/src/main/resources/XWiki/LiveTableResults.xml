## the $extra variable is passed to the call to #gridresultwithfilter below and is used to perform some default
## filtering on the LiveTable data even when the user has not performed any column filtering yet.
## When users start using column filtering, the generated DB query will combine both the default filtering and what the
## user has entered in the column filters.
#set ($extra = '')
#set ($params = {})
#if ("$!request.space" != '')
  #set ($extra = "${extra} AND doc.space = :doc_space")
  #set ($discard = $params.put('doc_space', $request.space))
#end
## Use filterLocation since addLivetableLocationFilter is buggy when called several times (it'll add the
## same HQL binding name every time it's called! See https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17463).
## Also note that we don't call addLocationFilter since we use a Map for $params.
#filterLocation($extra, $params, $!request.location, 'locationFilterValue1')

Put here the channels configuration files or use embedded JGroups configuration files (recommanded).

The channel configuration file should match the channel identifier with ".xml" extension. For example for channel "udp" the file is "udp.xml".

You can find the list of embedded JGroups configuration files in the jgroups jar file located in WEB-INF/lib/ folder.

You can find detailed documentation on what to put in JGroups configuration files at http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JGroups.

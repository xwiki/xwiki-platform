/**
 * Implementation of the {@link FormulaRenderer} component, which uses the <a
 * href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Chart APIs</a> as a remote service for rendering mathematical
 * formulae. The quality of the results is between those obtained from the native TeX system and those from SnuggleTeX,
 * with the advantage that it doesn't require the presence of a local TeX installation, but with the disadvantages that
 * it requires fast, continuous access to an external server, for high traffic you must notify Google of your usage,
 * only block-level equations are produced, there's no support (yet?) for different font sizes and image formats, and
 * the results are not 100% in accordance with the TeX syntax (for example it does not understand \root, the content
 * between \left and \right is lowered). This service is still in an early stage, so it might improve in the future.
 * 
 * @version $Id$

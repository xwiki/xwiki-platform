## TODO: Code copied from displayer_email.vm. Introduce an email picker, see https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17290
## which will also remove the code duplication.
## TODO: Improve this code so that it doesn't rely on magical page references and uses a stable API.
## Also this displayer should not be located in platform-web but in the mail extension so that it exists only if that
## extension is installed.
## TODO: Also provide a java and scripting API to perform email obfuscation, and call it.

 * Extension to <code>{@link org.dom4j.io.XMLWriter}</code> to allow filling some element content with an input stream,
 * minimizing the memory footprint of the operation.

 * produced without building the document tree in memory. It is not compatible with the SAX part of the original
 * <code>{@link org.dom4j.io.XMLWriter}</code>.

 * An improvement to the writeOpen/writeClose functions ensure better handling of independent opening and closing of
 * tags by maintaining a state stack of opened tags. New writeDocumentStart/End function also ensure proper starting and
 * ending of the document it self.

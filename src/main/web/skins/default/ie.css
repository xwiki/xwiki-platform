/*

Min- and max-width implementation for Windows Internet Explorer

About the weird dynamic property expression

fs = font-size (from the #em element)
min = min-width
max = max-width
po = padding offset (from the body)
bo = border offset (from the #main container, IE 6 seems to need one additional px)
cw = client width
px = pixel

(Feel free to suggest more intuitive names.)

Quriks-mode vs. standards-mode

This expression is the result of extensive trial and error.
I quess reading widths is equal in quirks- and standards-mode
(in this demo), but setting them is different. I don't want
to account for those differences, because they are very little.

# This contains the translations of the module in the default language
# (generally English).
# 
# Translation key syntax:
#   <short top level project name>.<short module name>.<propertyName>
#   where:
#   * <short top level project name> = top level project name without the "xwiki-" prefix,
#                                     for example: commons, rendering, platform, enterprise, manager, etc
#   * <short module name> = the name of the Maven module without the <short top level project name> prefix,
#                           for example: oldcore, scheduler, activitystream, etc
#   * <propertyName> = the name of the property using camel case,
#                      for example updateJobClassCommitComment
#
# Comments: it's possible to add some detail about a key to make easier to
#   translate it by adding a comment before it. To make sure a comment is not
#   assigned to the following key use at least three sharps (###) for the comment
#   or after it.
# 
# Deprecated keys:
#   * when deleting a key it should be moved to deprecated section at the end
#     of the file (between #@deprecatedstart and #@deprecatedend) and associated to the
#     first version in which it started to be deprecated
#   * when renaming a key, it should be moved to the same deprecated section
#     and a comment should be added with the following syntax:
#     #@deprecated new.key.name
#     old.key.name=Some translation

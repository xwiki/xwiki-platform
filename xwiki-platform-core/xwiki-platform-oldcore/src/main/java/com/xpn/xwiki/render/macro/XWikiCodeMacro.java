/**
 * The Code Macro renders its content as is but pretty printed according to the language passed as parameter. Supporting
 * escaping Radeox, Velocity and Groovy wasn't trivial. Here's how it's currently implemented (waiting for a better
 * implementation):
 * <ol>
 * <li>The first renderer to execute is the MacroMappingRenderer. That's because it's registered first in
 *     {@link com.xpn.xwiki.render.DefaultXWikiRenderingEngine#DefaultXWikiRenderingEngine(com.xpn.xwiki.XWiki, com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiContext)}}.
 *     The code macro is registered in the macros.txt file used by the MacroMappingRenderer and thus it is processed
 *     by the macro mapping feature. Since it recognizes it's a radeox macro, it calls the Radeox Renderer's
 *     {@link com.xpn.xwiki.render.XWikiRadeoxRenderer#convertMultiLine(String, String, String, String, com.xpn.xwiki.render.XWikiVirtualMacro, com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiContext)}
 *     method. This method has a hack and verifies if the macro to render is the code macro. If so it escapes Velocity
 *     and Groovy special characters ($, #, <% and %>) so that when the Velocity and Radeox renderers execute they do
 *     not process its content.</li>
 * <li>We also don't want the Radeox renderer to render the code macro's content. We do this by having a special Radeox
 *     Filter ({@link com.xpn.xwiki.render.filter.CodeRemoveFilter} that is defined before all other filters in
 *     the <code>META-INF/services/com.xpn.xwiki.render.filter.XWikiFilter</code> file and that removes the content of
 *     the code macro. The other filters then execute. The last but one defined filter is
 *     {@link com.xpn.xwiki.render.filter.CodeRestoreFilter} which puts back the content of the code macro and the last
 *     filter is the {@link com.xpn.xwiki.render.filter.CodeFilter} filter which calls this macro.</li>
 * </ol>

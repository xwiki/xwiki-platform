  Context configuration file for the XWiki Web App

  This file is used only for Tomcat8 deployment of XWiki via debian packages.
  It is equivalent to, and needs to be kept up to date with traditional
  deployment file:
  xwiki-platform/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml

  Prevent JAR scanning and disable WebSocket and JSP support. 
  This is done to optimize Tomcat startup time, per
  https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp &
  https://tcollignon.github.io/2016/02/09/Accelerate-tomcat-78-start-up.html
  (see: "Disable scanning the web application", 
        "Disable scanning web-fragment jar",
        "Disable both WebSocket and JSP support", 
        "Excludes jars for scanning")
-->

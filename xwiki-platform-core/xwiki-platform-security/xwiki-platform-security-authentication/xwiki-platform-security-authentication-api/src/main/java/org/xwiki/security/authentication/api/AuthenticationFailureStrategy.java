/**
 * Describes a strategy to perform in case the limit of authentication failures is reached.
 * See {@link AuthenticationConfiguration} for a definition of this limit.
 * Note that this strategy might be called even for users before reaching the authentication limit, this is done in
 * order to prevent the following scenario:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>an attacker tries to login x times with a login</li>
 *     <li>a CAPTCHA is displayed in form to mitigate the attack</li>
 *     <li>the attacker tries to perform the attack on a different login</li>
 * </ul>
 * In this case if the CAPTCHA is displayed, we should use it also to prevent attacking the other user.

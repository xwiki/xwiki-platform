/**

 * <ul>
 *   <li>When an attachment is rendered during the export (specifically when {@code pdf.vm} is rendered), the
 *   {@link PdfURLFactory} is called and it saves the Attachment Entity Reference in a map in the XWiki Context</li>
 *   <li>When Apache FOP embeds an image it calls this URI Resolver and we try to locate the Attachment Entity
 *   Reference from that map and return the attachment stream.</li>
 *   <li>Attachment links do not call the Resolver and are thus exported correctly using a full URL to the XWiki
 *   server</li>

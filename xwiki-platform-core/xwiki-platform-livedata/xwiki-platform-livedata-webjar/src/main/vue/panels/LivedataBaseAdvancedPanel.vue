<!--
  LivedataBaseAdvancedPanel is a component that provide for advanced panels
  an interface that already handles the panel's base behavior:
  open from dropdown menu, close, and also the panel display style.
  It is not meant to be used directly, but instead to be used inside a
  specific advanced panel that pass to it a `title` and `body` slot.
  In that way, Advanced panels only care about implementing
  the content of the panel, rather the reimplemting the whole panel logic
  each time.

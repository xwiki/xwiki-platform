### Missing: admin.ratings.activateratings=Activate the ratings on this wiki
### Missing: admin.ratings.activateratingsinfo=Activating the ratings on this wiki will display a visual average rating (composed of stars) at the top right corner of each document of this wiki (except the ones in the *XWiki* space). Authenticated users will be able to rate documents by clicking on the stars. An alternative to this is to use the *Ratings Panel*, for example to only enable ratings in the desired spaces. To use the Ratings Panel, please visit the *Panel Wizard* administration section.
### Missing: admin.ratings.resetratings=Reset all the ratings on this wiki. This will make all documents start over with no vote. Be aware that this operation is irreversible, besides on a document-per-document rollback basis. Resetting all ratings can take a while if the wiki has a large amount of documents already rated.
### Missing: admin.ratings.uninstallratings=Uninstalling the ratings application will delete the documents that compose the application, but *all votes on rated document will be preserved*. If you reinstall the application later on, the documents will start over with the saved average rating they had before uninstalling the application. Finally, uninstalling the ratings application will *remove the ratings category* from the wiki administration.
### Missing: admin.ratings.ratingsactivated=Ratings have been activated
### Missing: admin.ratings.ratingsdeactivated=Ratings have been deactivated
### Missing: admin.ratings.illegalrequest=Illegal request

### Missing: rating.yourvote=Your vote
### Missing: rating.logintorate=Login to rate
### Missing: rating.novotes=No votes yet

  <!-- Named queries for the Nested Pages hierarchy -->
  <!--                                              -->

  <!-- When displaying the page hierarchy (e.g. using the tree widget) we need to get information from both the
    documents table and the spaces table. Each of these tables contains some information that is not found on the other.
    The documents table contains the terminal pages while the spaces table contains the "empty" spaces (no direct
    terminal child pages). In order to get all the needed information we need to perform a union or an outer join
    (between unrelated Hibernate entities). The Hibernate version we use doesn't support either (HHH-1050 and HHH-16) so
    we are forced to use native SQL queries. See XWIKI-13468. In the future we could merge the documents and spaces
    tables into a single one (the pages table)

    Moreover, in order to sort the pages by their translated raw title (XWIKI-12832) we need to perform an outer join
    (because we want to fall-back on the default title and then on the page name). The Hibernate version we use doesn't
    support this because the translations are not mapped as aggregated entities (HHH-16) so we are again forced to use
    native SQL queries.

    Another solution that we tried was to define two new entities XWikiPage and XWikiPageTranslation that were mapped to
    a SQL query (e.g. the union between the documents and spaces tables) rather than to an existing table. This had the
    advantage that the new entities could be queried using HQL and we could perform an outer join between the XWikiPage
    and the aggregated translations. The problem was that the sort by page title was very slow on MySql, because there
    were many constraints applied to the union instead of the inner selects and so MySql could not use the indexes.

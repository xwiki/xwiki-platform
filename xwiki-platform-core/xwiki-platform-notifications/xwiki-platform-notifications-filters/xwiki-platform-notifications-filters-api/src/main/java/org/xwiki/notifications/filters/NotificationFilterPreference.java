 * Define the preference of a notification filter.
 * A notification filter preference represents a set of parameters that can be passed to a filter in order to
 * customize it.
 *
 * Example :
 * Letâ€™s say that we have defined a filter based on the wiki users : in order to work, this filter needs to know
 * which wiki users he has to filter, and for which types of events he should be applied.
 *
 * Those wiki users and those event types are like parameters to the filter, a {@link NotificationFilterPreference}
 * is nothing else than a combination of those parameters.

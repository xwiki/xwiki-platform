/**
 * <p>
 * Action for previewing document changes. It prepares a temporarily changed document which is placed in the context,
 * without actually saving anything. The response is normally rendered by the {@code preview.vm} template.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This action also works like a request dispatcher, an early work-around for the fact that in HTML a form can only have
 * one destination URL. Thus, the form had to be submitted to one action which would further dispatch the request to
 * other actions, based on the clicked form button. Since preview is the safest method of the possible form actions, it
 * was chosen as the dispatcher. Currently this functionality is deprecated and maintained only for backwards
 * compatibility with older skins, since a cleaner dispatcher was implemented in {@link ActionFilter}.

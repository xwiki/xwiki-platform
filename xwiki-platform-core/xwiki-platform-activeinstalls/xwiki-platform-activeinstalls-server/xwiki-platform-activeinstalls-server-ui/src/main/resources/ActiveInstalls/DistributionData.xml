## Note: We filter "distributionFeatures" for 2 reasons:
## - It allows us to filter all distributions done by the XWiki dev team.
## - We started sending the "distributionFeatures" property at the same time as we started sending various
##   distribution id that represent what packaging is being used to install XWiki (before that we were sending a unique
##   distribution id). Thus by filtering on "xwiki" we're sure to not get older distribution ids and we can have
##   meaningful data to present.
## Those new behaviors were introduced in XWiki 8.4.

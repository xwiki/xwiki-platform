/**
 * JUnit TestSetup extension that starts/stops XWiki using a script passed using System Properties. These properties are
 * meant to be passed by the underlying build system. This class is meant to wrap a JUnit TestSuite. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;code&gt;
 * public static Test suite()
 * {
 *     // Create some TestSuite object here
 *     return new XWikiTestSetup(suite);
 * }
 * &lt;/code&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note: We could start XWiki using Java directly but we're using a script so that we can test the exact same script
 * used by XWiki users who download the standalone distribution.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @version $Id$
 * @deprecated use {@link XWikiExecutorSuite} instead

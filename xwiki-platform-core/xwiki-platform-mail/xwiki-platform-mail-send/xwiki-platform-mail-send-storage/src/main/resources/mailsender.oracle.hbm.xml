  <!-- This file is a copy of mailsender.hbm.xml with the following modification:
       - When using "text" or "string" types:
         - When size <= 2000 Hibernate maps it to CHAR
         - When size > 2000 and <= 4000 Hibernates maps it to VARCHAR2
         - When size > 4000 Hibernates maps it to LONG. However LONG is deprecated in Oracle and shouldn't be used
           since Oracle imposes a limitation on it: there can be only be one LONG column per table. Thus when
           size > 4000 chars we must use a "materialized_clob" type
           See https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-5569
       - Thus, use the following strategy: use the "string" type when size<4000 and materialized_clob when size>40000
       - Lots of columns have not-null="false", since Oracle treats the empty string as NULL
       - Numeric index columns have an explicit sql-type="integer"
       - materialized_clob mapping to a org.hibernate.type.StringClobType type
  -->

  <!-- JDBC driver will try to map a materialized_clob type to a java.sql.Clob Java type when loading objects from
       the DB thus causing a Class Cast Exception since we use String types in Java and not java.sql.Clob
       (see https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-5659).
       See also https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateCoreMigrationGuide36
       Thus we need to tell Hibernate to map materialized_clob to String.

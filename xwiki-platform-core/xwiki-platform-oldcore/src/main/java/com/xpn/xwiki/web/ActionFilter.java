/**
 * A filter that dispatches requests to the right action, depending on the button that was pressed in the editing form.
 * This is needed since the browser cannot send the form data to different URLs depending on the button pressed, and an
 * XHTML form has only one target URL. In previous versions of XWiki this was accomplished using javascript code, with a
 * fall-back on a pseudo-dispatcher inside the {@link PreviewAction}, which was on obvious case of bad code design.
 * <p>
 * The filter dispatches requests based on the presence of a request parameter starting with <tt>action_</tt> followed
 * by the name of the struts action that should actually process the request. For example, the button that does
 * <tt>Save and Continue</tt> looks like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;action_saveandcontinue&quot; value=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * As a result, when clicking the button, the request is not sent to the form's target (<tt>preview</tt>), but is
 * actually forwarded internally to <tt>/bin/saveandcontinue/The/Document</tt>.
 *
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 1.8M1

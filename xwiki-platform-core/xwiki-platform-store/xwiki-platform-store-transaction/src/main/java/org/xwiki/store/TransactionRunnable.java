/**
 * A construct for altering storage in a safe way.
 * TransactionRunnable represents a storage transaction or a unit of work which may be done inside
 * of a transaction. It provides hooks to aquire locks, do work, commit and or roll the work back,
 * and release locks and cleanup temporary storage. Unless a TransactionRunnable extends
 * StartableTransactionRunnable, it must be run inside of another transaction and it may by the generic
 * <T> specify that it can only be run inside of a certian type of TransactionRunnable.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of TransactionRunnable which this TransactionRunnable must be run inside of.
 * A TransactionRunnable which alters a database through Hibernate would fail if it was
 * started outside of a TransactionRunnable which began and committed a transaction around
 * it. A class which extends TransactionRunnable<DatabaseTransactionRunnable> can only be
 * run inside of a DatabaseTransactionRunnable or a subclass of it. Breaking that rule will
 * be a compile time error.
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 3.0M2

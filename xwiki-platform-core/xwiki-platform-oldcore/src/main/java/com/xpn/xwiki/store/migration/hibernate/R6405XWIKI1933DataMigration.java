 * Migration for XWIKI1933: Editing users fails.
 *
 * Note: This data migration should only be executed if the R4340XWIKI833 one has already been executed
 * during a previous migration (i.e. if the database is in version >= 4340). This is because it
 * fixes a bug that cause the previous data migration to have only been executed in the main wiki, and
 * there was some code that inserted wrong data after the migration.

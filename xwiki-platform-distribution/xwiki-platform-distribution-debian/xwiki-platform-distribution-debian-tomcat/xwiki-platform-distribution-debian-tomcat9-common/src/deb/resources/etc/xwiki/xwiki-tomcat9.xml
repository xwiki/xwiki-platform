  Context configuration file for the XWiki Web App

  This file is used only for Tomcat9 deployment of XWiki via debian packages.
  It is equivalent to, and needs to be kept up to date with traditional
  deployment file:
  xwiki-platform/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/xwiki-platform-web-war/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml

  Prevent JAR scanning and disable JSP support in order to optimize Tomcat startup time. Note that we keep WebSocket
  support enabled because it is needed by the real-time editing.
  See https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp &
  https://tcollignon.github.io/2016/02/09/Accelerate-tomcat-78-start-up.html
  (sections "Disable scanning the web application", "Disable scanning web-fragment jar", "Excludes jars for scanning",
  "Disable JSP support")

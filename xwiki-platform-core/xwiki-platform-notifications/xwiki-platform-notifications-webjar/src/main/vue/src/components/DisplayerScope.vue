  DisplayerScope is a special custom displayer that displays the scope of a notification filter and an icon associated.

<template>
  <!--
    Uses the BaseDisplayer as root element, as it handles for us all the displayer default behavior.

    <!--
      The displayer does not have an Editor widget. Therefore, we leave the editor template empty.
      Moreover, we add the `view-only` property on the BaseDisplayer component so that user can't possibly switch 
      to the Editor widget.

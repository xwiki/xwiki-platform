<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <!-- In order to avoid getting a "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Form too large" error when editing large page in
       XWiki we need to tell Jetty to allow for large content since by default it only allows for 20K. We do this by
       passing the "org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.maxFormContentSize" attribute.
       Note 1: Setting this value too high can leave your server vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
       Note 2: We're setting it here instead of in Jetty's XML configuration files so that the XWiki WAR can be used
       in any Jetty config and work out of the box.
  -->
  <Set name="maxFormContentSize">1000000</Set>
  <!-- Increasing the maxFormKeys in order to be able to import correctly a full wiki (more than 1000 pages in 11.10).
  The import should be fixed at a point to allow importing everything without creating a form with a field by page.
  Once done this configuration can be removed. See https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11597 for a follow up. -->
  <Set name="maxFormKeys">2000</Set>

  <!-- Tell jetty that javax.mail should be something that is invisible to the user, but if it's provided inside the
       webapp use that instead (this is the case for XWiki). This is needed for work around issue
       https://github.com/appropriate/docker-jetty/issues/108. Note that we don't have this problem in the XWiki
       Standalone packaging since we create a custom distribution of Jetty and we don't include the Jetty "mail"
       module. However we have the problem in our functional Docker-based tests where we use the official Jetty
       image. -->

# Preamble
#
# This is the main old XWiki configuration file. Commented parameters show the default value, although some features
# might be disabled. To customize, uncomment and put your own value instead.
# 
# This file come from one of those locations (in this order):
# * [since 9.3] /etc/xwiki/xwiki.cfg
# * /WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg in the web application resources

#---------------------------------------
# General wiki settings
#

#-# When the wiki is readonly, any updates are forbidden. To mark readonly, use one of: yes, 1, true
# xwiki.readonly=no

#-# [Since 1.6RC1] The list of supported syntaxes is defined as an xobject in the Rendering.RenderingConfig page
#-# and you can change it using the Admin UI of XWiki. When the Rendering.RenderingConfig page doesn't exist, the list
#-# of supported syntaxes is taken from this property. And if there's no syntax listed, then the default syntax is
#-# supported by defaut (this default syntax is defined in xwiki.properties using the core.defaultDocumentSyntax
#-# property).
#-# Example of syntaxes:
#-#    xwiki/2.0, xwiki/2.1, confluence/1.0, jspwiki/1.0, creole/1.0,  mediawiki/1.0, twiki/1.0, xhtml/1.0,
#-#    html/4.01, plain/1.0, docbook/4.4, markdown/1.0, markdown/1.1, apt/1.0
#-# xwiki.rendering.syntaxes = xwiki/2.1

#-# List of groups that a new user should be added to by default after registering. Comma-separated list of group
#-# document names.
#-# The default list depends on the value of xwiki.authentication.group.allgroupimplicit:
#-# 0: created users are added to XWiki.XWikiAllGroup group page
#-# 1: created users are not added to any group page (but they will virtually be part of XWiki.XWikiAllGroup group)
# xwiki.users.initialGroups=XWiki.XWikiAllGroup

#-# Should all users be considered members of XWiki.XWikiAllGroup, even if they don't have an associated object in the
#-# group's document?
#-# 0: XWiki.XWikiAllGroup behaves like any other group and, by default, new users are added to it (you can change that using xwiki.users.initialGroups)
#-# 1: All users are considered members of the XWiki.XWikiAllGroup group no matter what it actually contains
#-# The default is 0.
# xwiki.authentication.group.allgroupimplicit=0

#-# Uncomment if you want to ignore requests for unmapped actions, and simply display the document
# xwiki.unknownActionResponse=view

#-# The encoding to use when transformin strings to and from byte arrays. This causes the jvm encoding to be ignored,
#-# since we want to be independend of the underlying system.
xwiki.encoding=$xwikiCfgEncoding

#-# This parameter will activate the sectional editing.
xwiki.section.edit=1

#-# This parameter controls the depth of sections that have section editing.
#-# By default level 1 and level 2 sections have section editing.
xwiki.section.depth=2

#-# Enable backlinks storage, which increases the update time, but allows to keep track of inter document links.
xwiki.backlinks=1

#-# Enable document tags.
xwiki.tags=1

#-# [Since 6.1M1] HTTP cache settings: by default, HTTP responses generated by XWiki actions are not supposed to be cached,
#-# since they often contain dynamic content. This can be controlled globally using the following setting, with accepted values:
#-# - 0: no Cache-Control header sent, use the browser's defaults. RFC 2616 only specifies optional behavior in this case
#-# - 1: no-cache; caches must not serve this response in a subsequent response, but the page is stored for the bf-cache
#-# - 2: no-store, no-cache and max-age=0; the response will never be reused, not even for bf-cache; note that unsaved changes may be lost
#-# - 3: private; the response will be cached by personal caches, such as a browser cache
#-# - 4: public; the response may be cached by both personal and shared caches
#-# This can be overridden in each wiki using a headers_nocache XWikiPreferences property of type Long.
# xwiki.httpheaders.cache=1

#---------------------------------------
# Storage
#

#-# Role hints that differentiate implementations of the various storage components. To add a new implementation for
#-# one of the storages, implement the appropriate interface and declare it in a components.xml file (using a role-hint
#-# other than 'default') and put its hint here.

#-# Stores with both "hibernate" and "file" support in XWiki Standard.
#-# [Since 10.5RC1] The default is "file" for all of them.
#-# 
#-# [Since 9.0RC1] The default document content recycle bin storage.
#-# This property is only taken into account when deleting a document and has no effect on already deleted documents.
# xwiki.store.recyclebin.content.hint=file
#-# The attachment content storage.
# xwiki.store.attachment.hint=file
#-# The attachment versioning storage. Use 'void' to disable attachment versioning.
# xwiki.store.attachment.versioning.hint=file
#-# [Since 9.9RC1] The default attachment content recycle bin storage.
#-# This property is only taken into account when deleting an attachment and has no effect on already deleted documents.
# xwiki.store.attachment.recyclebin.content.hint=file

#-# Stores with only "hibernate" support in XWiki Standard
#-# 
#-# The main (documents) storage.
# xwiki.store.main.hint=hibernate
#-# The document versioning storage.
# xwiki.store.versioning.hint=hibernate
#-# The document recycle bin metadata storage.
# xwiki.store.recyclebin.hint=hibernate
#-# The attachment recycle bin metadata storage.
# xwiki.store.attachment.recyclebin.hint=hibernate
#-# The Migration manager.
# xwiki.store.migration.manager.hint=hibernate

#-# Whether the document recycle bin feature is activated or not
# xwiki.recyclebin=1
#-# Whether the attachment recycle bin feature is activated or not
# storage.attachment.recyclebin=1
#-# Whether the document versioning feature is activated or not
# xwiki.store.versioning=1
#-# Whether the attachment versioning feature is activated or not
# xwiki.store.attachment.versioning=1
#-# Whether the attachments should also be rolled back when a document is reverted.
# xwiki.store.rollbackattachmentwithdocuments=1

#-# The path to the hibernate configuration file.
# xwiki.store.hibernate.path=/WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml

#-# Allow or disable custom mapping for particular XClasses. Custom mapping may increase the performance of certain
#-# queries when large number of objects from particular classes are used in the wiki.
# xwiki.store.hibernate.custommapping=1
#-# Dynamic custom mapping.
# xwiki.store.hibernate.custommapping.dynamic=0

#-# Put a cache in front of the document store. This greatly improves performance at the cost of memory consumption.
#-# Disable only when memory is critical.
# xwiki.store.cache=1

#-# Maximum number of documents to keep in the cache.
#-# The default is 500.
# xwiki.store.cache.capacity=500

#-# Maximum number of documents to keep in the cache indicating if a document exist.
#-# Since this cache contain only boolean it can be very big without taking much memory.
#-# The default is 10000.
# xwiki.store.cache.pageexistcapacity=10000

#-# [Since 1.6M1]
#-# Force the database name for the main wiki.
# xwiki.db=xwiki

#-# [Since 1.6M1]
#-# Add a prefix to all databases names of each wiki.
# xwiki.db.prefix=


#---------------------------------------
# Data migrations and schema updates
#
# [Since 3.3M1] Migration and schema updates are now done together. Data migration manipulates the actual data,
# and schema updates change the layout of the database. Schema updates are require for proper database access
# and migration are useful for migrating data to new formats, correct errors introduced in older versions, or
# even for schema updates which are not backward compatible.

#-# Whether schema updates and migrations are enabled or not. Should be enabled when upgrading, but for a better
#-# startup time it is better to disable them in production.
xwiki.store.migration=1

#-# Whether to exit after migration. Useful when a server should handle migrations for a large database, without going
#-# live afterwards.
# xwiki.store.migration.exitAfterEnd=0

#-# Indicate the list of databases to migrate.
#-# to upgrade all wikis database set xwiki.store.migration.databases=all
#-# to upgrade just some wikis databases set xwiki.store.migration.databases=xwiki,wiki1,wiki2
#-# Note: the main wiki is always migrated whatever the configuration.
#-# [Since 3.3M1] default to migrate all databases
# xwiki.store.migration.databases=all

#---------------------------------------
# Internationalization
#

#-# By default, XWiki chooses the language specified by the client (browser) in the Accept-Language HTTP header. This
#-# allows to use the default language of the wiki when the user didn't manually choose a language.
# xwiki.language.preferDefault=0

#-# Force only one of the supported languages to be accepted. Default to true.
# xwiki.language.forceSupported=1


#---------------------------------------
# Virtual wikis (farm)
#

#-# Starting with XWiki 5.0M2, virtual mode is enabled by default.

#-# [Since 5.0M2]
#-# What to do when the requested wiki does not exist:
#-# - 0: (default) serve the main wiki
#-# - 1: display an error (customizable through wikidoesnotexist.vm or xwiki:XWiki.WikiDoesNotExist)
# xwiki.virtual.failOnWikiDoesNotExist=0

#-# Forbidden names that should not be allowed when creating a new wiki.
# xwiki.virtual.reserved_wikis=

#-# How virtual wikis are mapped to different URLs.
#-# If set to 0, then virtual wikis have different domain names, in the format http://wikiname.myfarm.net/.
#-# If set to 1 (the default), then the domain is common for the entire farm, but the path contains the wiki name,
#-# in the format http://myfarm.net/xwiki/wiki/wikiname/.
#-# Note that you can configure the "/wiki/" part with xwiki.virtual.usepath.servletpath property.
#if ($xwikiCfgVirtualUsepath)
xwiki.virtual.usepath=$xwikiCfgVirtualUsepath
#else
# xwiki.virtual.usepath=1
#end

#-# Configure the servlet action identifier for url path based multiwiki. It has also to be modified in web.xml.
# xwiki.virtual.usepath.servletpath=wiki

#---------------------------------------
# URLs
#

#-# The domain name to use when creating URLs to the default wiki. If set, the generated URLs will point to this server
#-# instead of the requested one. It should contain schema, domain and (optional) port, and the trailing /. For example:
#-# xwiki.home=http://www.xwiki.org/
#-# xwiki.home=http://wiki.mycompany.net:8080/
# xwiki.home=

#-# The name of the default URL factory that should be used.
# xwiki.urlfactory.serviceclass=com.xpn.xwiki.web.XWikiURLFactoryServiceImpl

#-# The default protocol to use when generating an external URL. Can be overwritten in the wiki descriptor ("secure" property).
#-# If not set, the following is used:
#-#   * during client request for the current wiki: the protocol from the URL used by the client
#-#   * for a different wiki or during background tasks (mails, etc.): information come from the wiki descriptor (also fallback on main wiki)
#-# For example:
#-# xwiki.url.protocol=https
# xwiki.url.protocol=
#-# The name of the webapp to use in the generated URLs. If not specified, the value is extracted from the request URL
#-# and thus it's generally not required to set it. However if you're deploying XWiki as ROOT in your Servlet Container
#-# and you're using XWiki 6.2.8+/6.4.3+/7.0+ you must set it to an empty value as otherwise the code cannot guess it.
#-# Note that not setting this property seemed to work on previous versions when deploying as ROOT but it was actually
#-# leading to errors from time to time, depending on what URL was used when doing the first request on the XWiki
#-# instance.
#-# For example:
#-# xwiki.webapppath=xwiki
# xwiki.webapppath=
#-# The default servlet mapping name to use in the generated URLs. The right value is taken from the request URL,
#-# preserving the requested servlet mapping, so setting this is not recommended in most cases. If set, the value should
#-# contain a trailing /, but not a leading one. For example:
#-# xwiki.servletpath=bin/
# xwiki.servletpath=
#-# The fallback servlet mapping name to use in the generated URLs. Unlike xwiki.servletpath, this is the value used
#-# when the correct setting could not be determined from the request URL. A good way to use this setting is to achieve
#-# short URLs, see https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ShortURLs/
# xwiki.defaultservletpath=bin/

#-# Whether the /view/ part of the URL should be included if the target action is 'view'.
# xwiki.showviewaction=1
#-# The name of the default space. This is displayed when the URL specifies a document, but not a space, or neither.
# xwiki.defaultweb=Main
#-# The name of the default page of a space. This is displayed when the URL specifies a space, but not a document, or
#-# neither.
# xwiki.defaultpage=WebHome
#-# Hide the /WebHome part of the URL when the document is the default one. Use 0 to hide, 1 to show.
# xwiki.usedefaultaction=0

#-# [Since 4.0RC1]
#-# Indicate if the URL used in HTTPSevlet#sendRedirect should be made absolute by XWiki or left to application server.
#-# Sending absolute URLs is a bad practice and generally not needed. This option is mostly here as retro-compatibility
#-# switch and you should always make sure to properly configure your application server or any proxy behind it before
#-# using this.
#-# 0: send relative URLs (the default)
#-# 1: send absolute URLs
# xwiki.redirect.absoluteurl=0

#---------------------------------------
# Users
#

xwiki.inactiveuser.allowedpages=


#---------------------------------------
# Authentication and authorization
#

#-# Enable to allow superadmin. It is disabled by default as this could be a
#-# security breach if it were set and you forgot about it. Should only be enabled
#-# for recovering the Wiki when the rights are completely messed.
#if ($xwikiCfgSuperadminPassword)
xwiki.superadminpassword=$xwikiCfgSuperadminPassword
#else
# xwiki.superadminpassword=system
#end

#-# Authentication type. You can use 'basic' to always use basic authentication.
# xwiki.authentication=form

#-# Indicate if the authentication has do be done for each request
#-# 0: the default value, authentication is done only once by session.
#-# 1: the authentication is done for each request.
# xwiki.authentication.always=0

#-# Cookie encryption keys. They are randomly generated and stored when not specified.
# xwiki.authentication.validationKey=totototototototototototototototo
# xwiki.authentication.encryptionKey=titititititititititititititititi

#-# Comma separated list of domains for which authentication cookies are set. This
#-# concerns mostly wiki farms. The exact meaning is that when a user logs in, if
#-# the current domain name corresponding to the wiki ends with one of the entries
#-# in this parameter, then the cookie is set for the larger domain. Otherwise, it
#-# is set for the exact domain name of the wiki.
#-#
#-# For example, suppose the cookiedomains is set to "mydomain.net". If I log in
#-# on wiki1.mydomain.net, then the cookie will be set for the entire mydomain.net
#-# domain, and if I visit wiki2.mydomain.net I will still be authenticated. If I log
#-# in on wiki1.otherdomain.net, then I will only be authenticated on
#-# wiki1.otherdomain.net, and not on wiki2.otherdomain.net.
#-#
#-# So you need this parameter set only for global authentication in a
#-# farm, there's no need to specify your domain name otherwise.
#-#
#-# Example: xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains=xwiki.org,myxwiki.org
xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains=

#-# This allows logout to happen for any page going through the /logout/ action, regardless of the document or the
#-# servlet.
#-# Comment-out if you want to enable logout only for /bin/logout/XWiki/XWikiLogout
#-# Currently accepted patterns:
#-# - /StrutsServletName/logout/ (this is usually /bin/logout/ and is the default setup)
#-# - /logout/ (this works with the short URLs configuration)
#-# - /wiki/SomeWikiName/logout/ (this works with path-based virtual wikis)
xwiki.authentication.logoutpage=(/|/[^/]+/|/wiki/[^/]+/)logout/*

#-# The group management class.
# xwiki.authentication.groupclass=com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.xwiki.XWikiGroupServiceImpl

#-# The authentication management class.
# xwiki.authentication.authclass=com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.xwiki.XWikiAuthServiceImpl

#-# (Deprecated) The authorization management class.
#-# [Since 5.0M2] The default right service is now org.xwiki.security.authorization.internal.XWikiCachingRightService
#-# which is a bridge to the new security authorization component. It provides increased security and performance, but
#-# its right policies differ sightly from the old Right Service implementation. In rare situation, you may want to
#-# switch back to the old unmaintained implementation by uncommenting the following line. However, only old
#-# implementation, still using a bridged RightService will be impacted by this parameter. Customization of the new
#-# security authorization component should be done in the new xwiki.properties configuration (security.*).
# xwiki.authentication.rightsclass=com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.xwiki.XWikiRightServiceImpl

#-# If an unauthenticated user (guest) tries to perform a restricted action, by default the wiki redirects to the login
#-# page. Enable this to simply display an "unauthorized" message instead, to hide the login form.
# xwiki.hidelogin=false

#-# Used by some authenticators (like com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.xwiki.AppServerTrustedAuthServiceImpl)
#-# to indicate that the users should be created. In this kind of authenticator the user are not created by default.
#-# Must be set to "empty".
# xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty

#-# If set to true(the default value), cookies of users are blocked from being used except by the same IP address 
#-# which got them.  
# xwiki.authentication.useip=true

#---------------------------------------
# Editing
#

#-# Minor edits don't participate in notifications.
# xwiki.minoredit=1

#-# Use edit comments
xwiki.editcomment=1

#-# Hide editcomment field and only use Javascript
# xwiki.editcomment.hidden=0

#-# Make edit comment mandatory
xwiki.editcomment.mandatory=$xwikiCfgEditCommentMandatory

#-# Make edit comment suggested (asks 1 time if the comment is empty.
#-# 1 shows one popup if comment is empty.
#-# 0 means there is no popup.
#-# This setting is ignored if mandatory is set
# xwiki.editcomment.suggested=0

#---------------------------------------
# Skins & Templates configuration
#

#-# The default skin to use when there's no value specified in the wiki preferences document. Note that the default
#-# wiki already specifies a skin, so this setting is only valid for empty wikis.
xwiki.defaultskin=$xwikiCfgDefaultSkin

#-# The default base for skins that don't specify a base skin. This is also the last place where a skin file is searched
#-# if not found in the more specific skins.
xwiki.defaultbaseskin=$!xwikiCfgDefaultBaseSkin

#-# Defines whether title handling should be using the compatibility mode or not. When the compatibility
#-# mode is active, XWiki will try to extract a title from the document content.
#-# If the document's content first header (level 1 or level 2) matches the document's title
#-# the first header is stripped.
#-# The default value is 0.
# xwiki.title.compatibility=1

#-# Defines the maximum header depth to look for when computing a document's title from its content. If no header
#-# equal or lower to the specified depth is found then the computed title falls back to the document name.
#-# The default value is 2.
# xwiki.title.headerdepth=2

#-# Defines if setting the title field must be mandatory in the WYSIWYG and Wiki editors. It is mandatory when this
#-# property is set to 1. The default value is 0 (not mandatory).
# xwiki.title.mandatory=0

#---------------------------------------
# Plugin Mechanism
#

#-# List of active plugins.
xwiki.plugins=$!xwikiCfgPlugins

#---------------------------------------
# Monitor Plugin
#

#-# Enable light monitoring of the wiki performance. Records various statistics, like number of requests processed,
#-# time spent in rendering or in the database, medium time for a request, etc. Disable for a minor increase of
#-# performance and a bit of memory.
# xwiki.monitor=1

#-# Maximum number of last requests to remember.
# xwiki.monitor.lastlistsize=20

#---------------------------------------
# Image Plugin
#

xwiki.plugin.image.cache.capacity=30

#---------------------------------------
# Watchlist Plugin
#

#-# [Since 3.1M1]
#-# Indicate which mode to use for automatic document watching.
#-# The possibles modes are the following:
#-# * none: never automatically add document in watchlist
#-# * all: add to watchlist any modified document
#-# * major: add to watchlist only document which are not edited as minor edit. That's the default mode.
#-# * new: add to watchlist only newly created documents
# xwiki.plugin.watchlist.automaticwatch=major

#---------------------------------------
# Statistics Plugin
#

#-# Note that this plugin is in charge of storing stats in the database, and offering some API to query them.
#-# It doesn't provide any UI. If you wish to install a UI, please check the Statistics Application at
#-# https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Statistics+Application
#-# (this application is no longer bundled in XWiki starting with 8.0)

#-# Stats configuration allows to globally activate/deactivate stats module (launch storage thread, register events...).
#-# Enabled by default.
# xwiki.stats=1
#-# When statistics are globally enabled, storage can be enabled/disabled by wiki using the XWikiPreference property
#-# "statistics".
#-# Note: Statistics are disabled by default for improved performances/space.
xwiki.stats.default=0

#-# Deprecated since 2.5M1. Use "xwiki.stats.request.excludedUsersAndGroups" instead.
# xwiki.stats.excludedUsersAndGroups=XWiki.Admin,XWiki.XWikiGuest

#-# [Since 2.5M1]
#-# List of users and groups to filter from the visit search request result. Entities are comma separated and can be
#-# relative.
#-# "XWiki.Admin" means "XWiki.Admin" user on the wiki where the search is done and "xwiki:XWiki.Admin" only filter
#-# admin user from main wiki.
#-# For example, the following filter default admin user and unregistered user from the most active contributor graph
#-# on Stats.WebHome page:
# xwiki.stats.request.excludedUsersAndGroups

#-# [Since 2.5M1]
#-# List of users and groups to skip when storing statistics to the database. Entities are comma separated and can be
#-# relative.
#-# "XWiki.Admin" means "XWiki.Admin" user on the wiki where the search is done and "xwiki:XWiki.Admin" only filter
#-# admin user from main wiki.
#-# For example, the following filter avoid storing statistics for the user "HiddenUser":
# xwiki.stats.excludedUsersAndGroups=XWiki.HiddenUser

#-# It is also possible to choose a different stats service to record statistics separately from XWiki.
# xwiki.stats.class=com.xpn.xwiki.stats.impl.XWikiStatsServiceImpl

#---------------------------------------
# Import/Export
#

#-# [Since 6.2]
#-# Indicate if Filter module should be used when exporting a XAR in the export action.
#-# By default Filter module is used, uncomment to use the old system.
# xwiki.action.export.xar.usefilter=0

#-# [Since 12.0]
#-# Indicate if the XAR packages should be optimized (from size point of view) by default.
#-# Can be overwritten with URL parameter "?optimized=false".
#-# The default is:
# xwiki.action.export.xar.optimized=1
#-# [Since 12.0]
#-# Indicate if the JRCS format should be used for attachment history in XAR packages by default.
#-# Enabled by default for retro compatibility reasons.
#-# Can be overwritten with URL parameter "?attachment_jrcs=false"
#-# The default is:
# xwiki.action.export.xar.attachment.jrcs=1

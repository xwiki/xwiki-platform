##
## Override the blacklisted spaces preference since we want to display users from the entire wiki (all spaces).
#set ($blacklistedSpaces = [])
##
## Call the gridresultwithfilter macro that generates the JSON. Hardcode the XWikiUsers class because we don't want others to use this page to avoid blacklisted spaces for other classes.
## Note: This page can be ignored if an override exists. However, we allow possible overrides to include this page and extend the livetable's query.
#gridresultwithfilter('XWiki.XWikiUsers' $request.collist.split(','), "$!extraFromClause", "$!extraWhereClause", $extraWhereClauseParameters)

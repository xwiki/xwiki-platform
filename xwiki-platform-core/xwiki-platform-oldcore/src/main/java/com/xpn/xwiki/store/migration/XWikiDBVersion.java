package com.xpn.xwiki.store.migration;

/**
 * Stores XWiki's data version in the database. Used to find out which migrations to execute based on the current data
 * version in the Database (each migration says which minimal version it requires to execute).
 * <p/>
 * The version scheme in the past was to use the SVN revision number of the commit of the migrator but since we've now
 * moved to Git we're now using an integer matching the current XWiki version and allowing for a range of 1000
 * migrations. So if you're writing the first migrator for version 5.2 of XWiki then the version will be 52000. If
 * you're writing the 2nd migration for XWiki 5.2 then its version would be 52001, etc.

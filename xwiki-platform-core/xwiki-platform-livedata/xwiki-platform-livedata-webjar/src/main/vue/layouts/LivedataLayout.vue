 <!--
  The LivedataLayout component is used to display formatted data to the user.

  There are several layout, which are defined by their unique id.
  They should follow the path and naming convention:
  ./<layoutid>/Layout<layoutid>.vue

  The LivedataLayout component directly handle for us the choice of
  which layout to use, based on the Logic `currentLayoutId` property,
  and dynamically import this layout component and mount it at runtime.
  If the layout can't be found, or there was an loading error,
  then it falls back to the default one
  (specified by the `defaultLayout` property in the Livedata configuration).
-->
<template>
  <div class="livedata-layout">

      <!--
        We are using the <keep-alive> tag in order to keep the layout mounted
        even when it is not displayed on the screen.
        This is a sort of caching, that avoid re-rendering the whole layout
        each time we switch back on it.

<body>
  <p>Offers APIs to convert URLs into Resource Reference objects and vice-versa.</p>
  <p>All XWiki modules should use this API when they need to manipulate URLs and should not manipulate the JDK's
     URL class. The reasons are:
     <ul>
       <li>reduce bugs: this module is well-tested, handles escaping and encoding properly, and more. It's likely
           that manipulating URLs by yourself would lead to bugs, especially since there are limitations with the
           JDK's URL implementation.</li>
       <li>allows plugging different XWiki URL schemes without having to change any other part of the code.</li>
     </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The only places where it's allowed to see the JDK's URL class is in system boundary code, in code accepting an
     external URL and transforming it into a XWiki Resource Reference and in code generating a URL from a
     XWiki Resource Reference for outside processes.
  </p>

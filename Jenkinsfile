// the "xwikiModule" global function/DSL.
// Note that the version used is the one defined in Jenkins but it can be overridden as follows:
// @Library("XWiki@<branch, tag, sha1>") _
// See https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin for details.

// TODO: Uncomment to have this maven project be built by https://ci.xwiki.org and to have SonarQube validate it at

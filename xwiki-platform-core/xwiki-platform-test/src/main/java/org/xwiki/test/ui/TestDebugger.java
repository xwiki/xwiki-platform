/**
 * Generates debugging information on test failure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>captures a screenshot of the browser window</li>
 * <li>logs the URL of the current page</li>
 * <li>logs the source of the current page</li>
 * </ul>
 * NOTE: The reason we also log when a test starts and passes is simply to overcome a deficiency in error reporting in
 * Jenkins. The reason is that Jenkins bases its test reporting on the Maven Surefire plugin reporting which itself is
 * using a file to report test status. Since ui-tests are using a test suite, {@link PageObjectSuite}, there's only a
 * single file generated and it's only generated when all tests have finished executing. Thus if a test hangs there
 * won't be any file generated and looking at the Jenkins UI it won't be possible to see which tests have executed.
 * <p>
 * Normally each JUnit Test Runner knows what test is executing and when it's finished and thus can report them in its
 * own console (as this is the case for IDEs for example). Again the issue here is that Jenkins doesn't have any JUnit
 * Test Runner but instead is calling JUnit by delegation to the Maven Surefire plugin.

# This contains the translations of the module in the default language
# (generally English).
# 
# Translation key syntax:
#   <short top level project name>.<short module name>.<propertyName>
#   where:
#   * <short top level project name> = top level project name without the "xwiki-" prefix,
#                                     for example: commons, rendering, platform, enterprise, manager, etc
#   * <short module name> = the name of the Maven module without the <short top level project name> prefix,
#                           for example: oldcore, scheduler, activitystream, etc
#   * <propertyName> = the name of the property using camel case,
#                      for example updateJobClassCommitComment
#
# Comments: it's possible to add some detail about a key to make easier to
#   translate it by adding a comment before it. To make sure a comment is not
#   assigned to the following key use at least three sharps (###) for the comment
#   or after it.
# 
# Deprecated keys:
#   * when deleting a key it should be moved to deprecated section at the end
#     of the file (between #@deprecatedstart and #@deprecatedend) and associated to the
#     first version in which it started to be deprecated
#   * when renaming a key, it should be moved to the same deprecated section
#     and a comment should be added with the following syntax:
#     #@deprecated new.key.name
#     old.key.name=Some translation

extension.xar.question.defaultConflictAction.hint=When dealing with XAR extensions it's possible to get conflicts (most of the time caused by changes made locally to documents belonging to extensions). When that happens, Extension Manager will try to choose the safest way to workaround the conflict but you can change the behavior using the following options.

extension.xar.conflict.MERGE_SUCCESS.label=Successful merge
extension.xar.conflict.MERGE_SUCCESS.hint=The three-way merge modified the document without any conflict

/**
 * Typed version of the entity reference resolver from string representations which gets its type from the string
 * serialization, in the form {@code type://} and, if no such type specification is found, it uses the default passed
 * type. <br />
 * For example, something like: {@code DOCUMENT://XWiki.TagClass[0]#tags} will result in parsing {@code
 * XWiki.TagClass[0]#tags} as a document reference, while {OBJECT_PROPERTY://XWiki.TagClass[0]#tags} will result in
 * parsing {@code XWiki.TagClass[0]#tags} as an object property reference.<br />
 * Note that, although it roughly does the same thing, this is a different hierarchy than EntityReferenceResolver
 * because it's a different strategy, different interpretation of the type parameter and resolvers & serializers of this
 * type should be used together.
